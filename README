-Please take special note of instructions for the following characters:

-Rogue - Leveling: This Rogue ability file is solely used to level without gaining any stolen powers whatsoever.  I highly recommend leveling her on a Monday in Midtown to take advantage of the massive xp acquireable there.  I've also added Vanish teleport support from Kirigi.  I highly recommend acquiring his teleport if possible.

-Magik - Summoner: Acquire a minion from anywhere once you are able to put a point into Eternal Servitude.  This will change the ability name to Back From Limbo.  A re-prep may be necessary.  Also be sure to level the minion up as you level.  Not super crucial, but don't be level 60 with a level 10 minion.  EVERY TIME Magik get's respecced, it erases her pet.  You'll have to go get another one.

-Spiderman: Apparently some of Spiderman's costumes change the roster list and/or name of his abilities.  Please let me know if you have any of the costumes and if they change anything, as I don't have any costumes for him.

-Emma Frost: Acquire a pet from Midtown once you are able to with Psychic Domination.  Also be sure to level the pet up as you level.  Not super crucial, but don't be level 60 with a level 10 pet

-Vision: Acquire a robot from Midtown once you are able to put a point into A.I. Hack.  Also be sure to level the robot up as you level.  Not super crucial, but don't be level 60 with a level 10 robot.
